# Minimal Lisp?

After net serfing for a while, I found some arguments
about what is the primitives of really minimal lisp.
Then, I came across this answer.

- [How many primitives does it take to build a LISP machine? Ten, seven or five?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3482389/how-many-primitives-does-it-take-to-build-a-lisp-machine-ten-seven-or-five)

So, are the five primitives, `atom`, `eq`, `car`, `cdr`, and `cons` minimal?
