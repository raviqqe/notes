# venv


Create a new virtual environment.

```
$ python -m venv $env_dir
```

Then, activate it.

```
$ . $env_dir/bin/activate
```

You can see some commands, such as `python`, and `pip` in `$env_dir/bin`.
When the virtual environment is activated,
everything in it is used for your current shell.

To deactivate it, run `deactivate` command.

```
$ deactivate
```
