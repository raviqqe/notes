## CUDA and PyCUDA finally installed properly

The last boss was that CUDA is not compatible with gcc later than 4.9.
Although the way suggested on the Internet to avoid the problem appears to be
a kind of stopgap, I adopted it because I just wanna utilize GPUs.
Following
[the guide](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Install-NVIDIA-CUDA-on-Fedora-22-with-gcc-5-1-654/),
I just commented out the error message.

```
#error -- unsupported xlC version! only xlC 13.1 is supported

#endif /* __ibmxl_vrm__ && (__ibmxl_vrm__ < 0x0d010000 && __ibmxl_vrm__ >= 0x0d020000) */

#endif /* __powerpc__ */

#if defined(__GNUC__)

#if __GNUC__ > 4 || (__GNUC__ == 4 && __GNUC_MINOR__ > 9)

//#error -- unsupported GNU version! gcc versions later than 4.9 are not supported!

#endif /* __GNUC__ > 4 || (__GNUC__ == 4 && __GNUC_MINOR__ > 9) */

#if defined(__APPLE__) && defined(__MACH__) && !defined(__clang__)
#error -- clang and clang++ are the only supported host compilers on Mac OS X!
#endif /* __APPLE__ && __MACH__ && !__clang__ */
```


## SLI doesn't seem to be recommended for GPU computing

The site below shows one opinion about nVidia SLI technology for
GPU computing. According to it, it doesn't seem to be recommended.
