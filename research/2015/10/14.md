* Fedora
  * Installation media fails to boot with the GPU specific driver.
  * It succeeds to boot with the VESA driver, but fails to install
    it into the HDD RAID because of the error of anaconda installer that
    a RAID partition has no name.

* Ubuntu
  * Installation media fails to boot with the GPU specific driver.
  * It succeeds to boot with the VESA driver, but fails to install it
    due to the error causing when the HDD RAID where Ubuntu will be installed
    is selected.
