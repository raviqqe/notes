# Reserach note

Posted on: 2015/10/14

## Installation failure on Cosmos II  

* Fedora
  * Installation media fails to boot with the GPU specific driver.
  * It succeeds to boot with the VESA driver, but fails to install
    it into the HDD RAID because of the error of anaconda installer that
    a RAID partition has no name.

* Ubuntu
  * Installation media fails to boot with the GPU specific driver.
  * It succeeds to boot with the VESA driver, but fails to install it
    due to the error causing when the HDD RAID where Ubuntu will be installed
    is selected.


## NN classifier

* Loss calculation per category is implemented
  * That improved the result by around 0.1% (39.9% -> 40.0%).

* Dropout is implemented.

* Activation function is changed into ReLU function.
  * That improved the learning speed much while the result seems to indecate
    a little more overfitting than logistic sigmoid function.
