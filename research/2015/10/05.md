## Discussion with my professor

* CNN seems to be more appropriate than RNN
* The implementation of statement vector can be delayed to the master
  * Recently, the better method of statement vector is published
* 2 new servers will arrive soon!
  Then, 36GB memory GPU will be available on SLI.
* Methods to refine word vectors on the NN classification phase
  * Extending the word vectors with small vectors
  * Update word vectors normalizing them for them not to go away from their
    original vectors (2015, NACL best paper)
* Make better word vectors (and paragraph vectors?)
  by utilizing Wikipedia and Yahoo! datasets
* Watch the videos, deep learning for NLP on YouTube by Richard Socher


## The best directory structure for MPME model ever

MPME stands for Muptiple-Project Multiple-Experiment.

* research
  * project
    * project\_A
      Contains source and object files for executable or library projects,
      or data files for dataset preparation projects.
    * project\_B
    * project\_C
  * experiment
    * experiment\_A
      * bin
        Contains symbolic links to binaries in each project directories.
      * var
        Contains symbolic links to data directories or files in each project
        directories.
    * experiment\_B
    * experiment\_C


## The paths of Wikipedia document extractor
