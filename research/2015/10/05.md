* CNN seems to be more appropriate than RNN
* The implementation of statement vector can be delayed to the master
  * Recently, the better method of statement vector is published
* 2 new servers will arrive soon!
  Then, 36GB memory GPU will be available on SLI.
* Methods to refine word vectors on the NN classification phase
  * Extending the word vectors with small vectors
  * Update word vectors normalizing them for them not to go away from their
    original vectors (2015, NACL best paper)
* Make better word vectors (and paragraph vectors?)
  by utilizing Wikipedia and Yahoo! datasets
* Watch the videos, deep learning for NLP on YouTube by Richard Socher
