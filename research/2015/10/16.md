# Research note

## Fedora installed into Cosmos II, Cooler Master

The problem was the status of RAID volume. When the RAID volume's status is
"Initialize", it cannot be installed into the volume. To do that, the status
should be "Normal".


## To-do list, so far

* Separate hyperparameters and other configuration infromation from binaries
  and scripts, convert them into files of modern configuration file format
  (such as YAML or TOML), and read them on running phase of the experiments.
  * They can be in the "etc" directory in each experiment one.
* Establish the process and tool to log and backup all information of each
  experiment.
* Implement the methods of deep learning more!
  * Limiting maximum of weight
    * Or weight decay
  * Normalization of data
    Normalize data's mean and variance for elements of each dimension in
    feature vectors.
