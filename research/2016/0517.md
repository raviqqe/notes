## OOM kill by CUDA?

This may be caused by too big vocabrary of words.
The word embeddings should not take up so much memory.
But, when calculating it, you map character IDs in words' chracter ID array
to character embeddings.
Therefore, the temporary word array becomes around a few 100MB
and OOM kill occurs.

Assume:

- number of words: 186850
- character embedding size: 64
- bytes / float32: 4
- word's max length: 8

186850 * 64 * 4 * 8 ~ 383MB

Oh, my memory.


## libcuda version error?

Binding `/usr/lib64/nvidia/libcuda.so.352.93`, the original library
to containers may help.
However, I cannot have figured out the whole problem yet.

Edit: It is fixed somehow by something.
