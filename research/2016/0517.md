## OOM kill by CUDA?

This may be caused by too big vocabrary of words.

- number of words: 186850
- word embedding size: 64
- bytes / float32: 4
- word's max length: 8

186850 * 64 * 4 * 8 ~ 383MB

Oh, my memory.


## libcuda version error?

Binding `/usr/lib64/nvidia/libcuda.so.352.93`, the original library
to containers may help.
However, I cannot have figured out the whole problem yet.
