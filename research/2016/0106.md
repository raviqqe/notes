## Significance threshold

Now, I'm trying to use 2 statistical significance tests
to evaluate ones of some result of my systems and methods.

* McNemar test
  This one is used for results of 2 systems which are corresponding
  to each other.
  For example, classes predicted by 2 systems can be tested by this.
  The P-value is calculated by Chi square distribution and number of instances
  whose predicted answers are changed from true to false
  or from false to true between 2 systems.
* Approximate randomization test
  This one is used to prove significant difference
  of some sort of real-value indicator, such as RMSE, between 2 systems.
  Randomizing instances and calculating the indicators on each system,
  P value is expected as the number of times
  where the indicator values exceed the original one
  divided by the number of randomization times.
