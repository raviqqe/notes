## How to develop models?

### How to tune numbers of epochs?

- Number of epochs is one of hyperparameters.
- Get all models per epoch and evaluate them with development data.
- Then, choose the number of epochs of the best accuracy.


### Others

- Sometimes, training data includes development data for better accuracies.
- Leave-one-out cross validation is the best way to do that but infeasible.
