# Stats on IMDb

The data is
[here](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz).
Tokenizing is done with nltk package in Python using Punkt corpus.

- Average sentences / document: 12.32574
- Average words / sentence: 21.45298
- Average characters / word: 4.015125

While it is known commonly that the average word length in English is around 5,
the one on IMDb is around 4.
This is because the words tokenized the reviews into includes
some punctuations (e.g. ', ", ., ,, (, ), and etc.)
and ones which construct phrases combined with other words
and abbreviated at the same time.
(Sorry for my damned English skill.
I'm saying about, for example, the "m" of "I'm", and the "ll" of "They'll".)
